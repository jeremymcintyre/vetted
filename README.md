## Visitor

Front end (in progress) for Visitor app uses JSX, React Router, Browserify and SASS.

The idea for the app is to have a simple way to keep track of fun things as you do them so that when you are looking for inspiration or someone is visiting you, you already have a personalized and curated list of things to do with them. Save activities to different people's lists, see them on a map, etc.

### Usage
